This is an attempt at gamification of John Conway's famous experiment, 'The game of Life'. It is my final project for CS499: Android Development.

# TODO
- Create settings option where user can adjust block color and other options
- Create some kind of high score system for challenge mode
- Add animation
- Add sound effects for individual blocks being born and dying
- Create base class for challenge activities to inherit from
 
# Known Issues
- Tapping on the very bottom on the srawing surface will cause the application to crash
